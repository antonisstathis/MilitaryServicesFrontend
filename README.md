# MilitaryServicesFrontend
This is the front end of the military services web application. It is strongly recommended anyone to read the documents
found here https://github.com/antonisstathis/MilitaryServicesDocs/tree/main/FrontEndDocs before runs or test the app. 
These documents provide the official front-end application documentation and explain everything the user or the tester needs to 
know, including its purpose, policies, and the mechanisms behind how it works. Skimming through the documentation will not be 
sufficient. It is important to carefully read all the lines in the .md files to fully understand the functionality, policies, and 
mechanisms of the application. In the readme file of the MilitaryServicesBackend repository someone can read what this app does. 
The front end is a Vue cli project and each component is a separate vue file. Below i attach the link of the readme file in the repository 
with the back end spring boot application. The back end spring boot application serves only datas. The requests are done from the async methods 
in the vue files (components).
