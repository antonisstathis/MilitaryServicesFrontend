# MilitaryServicesFrontend
This is the front end of the military services web application. In the readme file of the MilitaryServicesBackend repository
someone can read what this app does. The front end is a Vue cli project and each component is a separate vue file.
Below i attach the link of the readme file in the repository with the back end spring boot application. The back end
spring boot application serves only datas. The requests are done from the async methods in the vue files (components).
